## A Python Game Of Riddles

Riddler is a revolutionary game of riddles that only lets you solve one riddle about (SPOILER ALERT!) darkness and that’s it! I made it using Python just so I could practice loops and user inputs. You can fork it and make it more complex if you want it’s up to you.
 

## Getting Started
Open the "Game.py" file using a text editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and then run it so you can solve the riddle.
